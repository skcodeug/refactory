This is the recommended process of Code Refactoring:
1: Create a separate branch
2: Run code through a linter
3: Setup Code Climate to see the issues
4: Write unit tests
5: Refactor
6: Go to step 2: above and repeat the process

Hint: when refactoring; don't rename the file to another like ver2, etc; use the very same
